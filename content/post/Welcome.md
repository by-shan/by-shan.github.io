# Welcome!

This is my first time to set up a blog on my own by using Hugo, Git, Github & Rstudio. It's amazing but I'm still not well known all about this.

As a clinical statistical analyst, I'm using SAS often when taking this carrier. While R & Python are more and more popular. I decided to pick up my R skills back and maybe I will learn something about Python in very near future. 

To learn is happy. You find you know something new and a lot of other new things unknown.
To recall is sad. You knew you known, but it's hard to show the whole picture and the details immediately. 

This Blog aims to store & keep all things at least helpful and valuable to me.
